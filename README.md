A C++ compression and decompression program based on Huffman Coding.

# Algorithm:

Build a Huffman Tree from input characters.

Traverse the Huffman Tree and assign codes to characters.
<h3>Decompression</h3>
Recreate Huffman Tree based on Huffman Encode Table.

Decode the file based on the tree and store it to the desired file.
